<br>An eCommerce replica.
<br>This is one of my solo projects. After completing Lambda School(now Bloom Institute of Technology), I've decided to brush up on my newly learned skills and have created this app/site.
An eCommerce replica app. The user can favorite or add the desired image to the cart, where they can remove the speci�c item or place an order. The app is made by using ReactJS. It uses hooks, including useE�ect(to fetch data), useState(for creating states), useContext(including Provider, to send states and functions across app), BrowserRouter, Switch, Route and Link(to create link/route paths/urls). Deployment was done by using Vercel service.

Deployed app: https://picsome.vercel.app/
